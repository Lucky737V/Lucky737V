- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lucky737V
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding and scripting languages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java on NetBeans 12.5
- 💞️ I might try helping other people with their own projects, but I doubt I’ll do that while I’m learning the basics. I just don’t want to be a burden.
- 📫 How to reach me | I guess there's a way to send messages through this website, but I'm not really sure. If there's no such feature, then I might share my email.
